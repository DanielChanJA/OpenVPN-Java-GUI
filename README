Please note that this is a WIP (work-in-progress) and should not be used in deployed environments.


The ultimate goal for this project is for me to see how much I can do with Java and to eventually learn more as I progress with this project.

This project will be used alongside my VPN service, https://my.burstvpn.com/

Fork based on OAST 4.0 - http://oast.sourceforge.net/ for users in censored regions.
